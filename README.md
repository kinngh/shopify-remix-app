# [Work in progress] Shopify Remix / React Router x Prisma Boilerplate

An embedded app starter template to get up and ready with Shopify app development with Remix / React Router DOM and Prisma.

I've included [notes](/docs/NOTES.md) on this repo which goes over the repo on why certain choices were made.

## Supporting repositories

- [`@kinngh/shopify-nextjs-prisma-app`](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-nextjs-prisma-app): Shopify app starter repo built with Next.js and Prisma ORM.
- [`@kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app`](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app): Shopify app starter repo built with Express.js, React.js and Vite.
- [`@kinngh/shopify-polaris-playground`](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-polaris-playground): Build your app's UI using Polaris, without an internet connection.

## Why I made this

I need a usable Remix / React Router boilerplate.

## Are Remix and React Router different?

They have a branding crisis. It's the same thing. Use React Router since that's the `main`.

## Notes

- Refer to [SETUP](/docs/SETUP.md)
- The project comes with snippets to speed up development. Refer to [Snippets](/docs/SNIPPETS.md).
